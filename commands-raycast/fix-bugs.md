# Fix Bugs Command

Systematically debug and fix the reported issue with a comprehensive approach.

## Debugging Process

1. **Understand the Problem**
   - Read error messages carefully
   - Review stack traces
   - Identify when the issue occurs
   - Check recent code changes

2. **Reproduce the Issue**
   - Create minimal reproduction case
   - Verify the bug consistently occurs
   - Document steps to reproduce

3. **Investigate Root Cause**
   - Add logging/debugging statements
   - Check variable values
   - Review relevant code paths
   - Check dependencies and versions

4. **Implement Fix**
   - Address root cause, not symptoms
   - Ensure fix doesn't break other functionality
   - Keep changes minimal and focused
   - Follow coding standards

5. **Verify Fix**
   - Test the specific bug scenario
   - Run full test suite
   - Check for regression issues
   - Test edge cases

6. **Prevent Recurrence**
   - Add tests for the bug scenario
   - Document the issue and fix
   - Consider architectural improvements
   - Update error handling if needed

## Common Bug Categories

- Logic errors
- Type errors
- Race conditions
- Memory leaks
- Null/undefined references
- Off-by-one errors
- Configuration issues
- Dependency conflicts

Provide clear explanations of what was wrong and why the fix works.
