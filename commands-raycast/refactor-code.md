# Refactor Code Command

Refactor the specified code to improve its quality, maintainability, and performance while preserving functionality.

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Improve Readability**
   - Better variable and function names
   - Extract complex logic into smaller functions
   - Reduce nesting depth
   - Add clarifying comments

2. **Enhance Maintainability**
   - Remove code duplication (DRY)
   - Improve separation of concerns
   - Apply design patterns where appropriate
   - Simplify complex conditions

3. **Optimize Performance**
   - Reduce unnecessary computations
   - Optimize loops and iterations
   - Improve memory usage
   - Cache expensive operations

4. **Apply Best Practices**
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Use appropriate data structures
   - Handle errors properly
   - Add type safety (TypeScript)

## Refactoring Process

1. Analyze the current code
2. Identify improvement opportunities
3. Explain the proposed changes
4. Implement the refactoring
5. Ensure tests still pass

## Important

- Preserve existing functionality (no breaking changes)
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Keep commits small and focused
- Document significant changes
