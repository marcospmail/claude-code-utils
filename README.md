## Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations

- **Stream Processing** - Handles large conversation files efficiently using line-by-line reading
- **Debounced Search** - AI search queries are debounced by 500ms for optimal performance
- **Smart Scanning** - Only processes the 5 most recent projects and 5 most recent files per project

### Data Source

- Reads from `~/.claude/projects/` where Claude Code stores conversations
- Processes JSONL files containing timestamped messages
- Automatically finds the most recent conversations
- No data is sent to external servers (except for AI search with Raycast Pro)

### Limitations

- Scans 5 most recent projects with 5 most recent conversation files per project
- AI Search requires Raycast Pro subscription
- Large conversation files may take a moment to load initially

## Requirements

- **Raycast** 1.26.0 or higher
- **Node.js** 22.14 or higher
- **Claude Code** installed and configured
- **Raycast Pro** (optional, for AI search features)

## Troubleshooting

### No messages appearing

- Ensure Claude Code is installed and you have conversation history
- Check that `~/.claude/projects/` directory exists
- Try refreshing with `‚åò + R`

### Search not working

- For AI search, ensure you have Raycast Pro subscription
- Try switching to Normal search mode if AI search fails
- Clear search and try again

### Performance issues

- The extension scans the 5 most recent projects and 5 most recent files per project
- Large conversation files are processed efficiently using streaming
- Try closing and reopening if performance degrades

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing** - All data processing happens locally on your machine
- **No External Storage** - Your messages are never uploaded or stored externally
- **AI Search** - When using AI search, queries are processed by Raycast's AI service (Pro only)
